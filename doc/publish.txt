Introduction ~

The Vim text editor includes the script |2html.vim| which can be used to
convert a syntax highlighted buffer in Vim to an HTML document that, when
viewed in a web browser, should look exactly the same. After using that script
for a while and discovering the excellent Exuberant Ctags [1] I wondered
_"Wouldn't it be nice to have those tags converted to hyperlinks when I publish
source code as HTML?"_.

After several attempts I managed a working prototype, but it was quite rough
around the edges and I didn't really have the time or interest to clean it up.
Several months later I found myself with some free time and a renewed interest
in Vim scripting so I decided to clean up my code and release it. If you're
wondering what the result looks like, I've published the plug-in source code
[2] as a demonstration.

Installation & usage ~

_Please note that the vim-publish plug-in requires my vim-misc plug-in which is
separately distributed._

Unzip the most recent ZIP archives of the vim-publish [3] and vim-misc [4]
plug-ins inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is '~/.vim' on UNIX
and '%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles' on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command
':helptags ~/.vim/doc' (use ':helptags ~\vimfiles\doc' instead on Windows). If
you prefer you can also use Pathogen [5], Vundle [6] or a similar tool to
install & update the vim-publish [7] and vim-misc [8] plug-ins using a local
clone of the git repository.

As an example we'll publish the plug-in using itself. First create a tags file
that contains entries for the files you want to publish using a shell command
such as:
>
  $ ctags -Rf ~/.publish_tags ~/.vim/
<
If this doesn't work because |ctags| isn't installed you can download it from
the Exuberant Ctags homepage [1], or if you're running Debian/Ubuntu you can
install it by executing the following shell command:
>
  $ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
<
The plug-in needs an up-to-date tags file so that it can create hyperlinks
between the published files. Now start Vim and write a script that registers
the tags file you just created and calls the function 'Publish()' as follows:
>
  :set tags=~/.publish_tags
  :let sources = '/home/peter/.vim'
  :let target = 'sftp://peterodding.com/code/vim/profile'
  :call Publish(sources, target, [
      \ 'autoload/xolox/escape.vim',
      \ 'autoload/xolox/path.vim',
      \ 'autoload/publish.vim',
      \ 'plugin/publish.vim',
      \ ])
<
Change the 'sources' and 'target' variables to reflect your situation, save the
script as '~/publish_test.vim' and try it in Vim by executing the command
':source ~/publish_test.vim'. If everything goes well Vim will be busy for a
moment and after that you will find a bunch of syntax highlighted, interlinked
HTML documents in the 'target' directory!

                                                *publishing-to-remote-location*
Publishing to a remote location (website) ~

As you can see from the example above it's possible to publish files directly
to your web server using the |netrw| plug-in that's bundled with Vim, simply by
starting the 'target' path with 'sftp://'. All you need for this to work is the
ability to establish SCP [9] connections to your server. There are however two
disadvantages to remote publishing over SFTP [10]:

1. The 'publish.vim' plug-in can't automatically create directories on the
   remote side, which means you'll have to do so by hand -- very bothersome.

2. It can take a while to publish a dozen files because a new connection is
   established for every file that's uploaded to the remote location.

As a workaround to both of these issues the 'publish.vim' plug-in will
automatically use rsync [11] when both the local and remote system have it
installed. This cuts the time to publish to a remote location in half and
enables the plug-in to automatically create directories on the remote side.
