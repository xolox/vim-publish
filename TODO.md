Here's some things in the nice-to-have department:

 * Build a JavaScript color scheme switcher :-)

 * Hyperlink stuff like Vim functions in Vim scripts and Python standard library identifiers in Python scripts to their online documentation?

 * I once wrote a PHP script that created fancy looking dynamic directory listings for trees of source code published using a previous incarnation of this plug-in. You can [see it in action](http://peterodding.com/code/vim/profile/). Should I reincarnate that script as an add-on for the Vim plug-in that generates static index pages which don't need PHP but work just as well?

 * Automatically generate a temporary tags file up front? (So I don't have to rerun the plug-in when I break my [easytags.vim](http://peterodding.com/code/vim/easytags/) plug-in which also breaks the hyper linking feature of `publish.vim`.

 * Compare with [LXR](http://lxr.linux.no/+trees) in `README.md`?
