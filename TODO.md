Here's some things in the nice-to-have department:

 * Build a JavaScript color scheme switcher :-)

 * Hyperlink stuff like Vim functions in Vim scripts and Python standard
   library identifiers in Python scripts to their online documentation?

 * I once wrote a PHP script that created fancy looking dynamic directory
   listings for trees of source code published using a previous incarnation of
   this plug-in. Reincarnate that script as an add-on for the Vim plug-in that
   generates static index pages which don't need PHP but work just as well?
